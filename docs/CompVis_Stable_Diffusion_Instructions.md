# Running Stable Diffusion on a Single GPU with ONNX Runtime and DirectML

Check out our [blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/windowsai/dml-stable-diffusion/) for optimizing SD for efficient inference with ONNX and DirectML, as well as the driver support required to get the best performance. If you want to jump straight into the code, refer to [our sample in the Olive repo](https://github.com/microsoft/Olive/tree/main/examples/directml/stable_diffusion).
